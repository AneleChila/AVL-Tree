# AVL Tree
In class we learnt that an AVL Tree is faster than a BST Tree , we are to determine if this is actually true.
The problem in hand is to creat an Electronic Telephone Directory given a file listing names and details of people, details including address and contact details. . 
The file list is to be Inserted into a data structure .A data structure is a computational tool that manages data for storing , removing ,replacing and searching for data (other operations for managing data also including).
The data structure created in this project is called an AVL Tree. The AVL will be inserted data(details of a person) into, the data can then be managed by operations. 
The operations we are interested in are the Insert, Searchmethod and the Delete-method. The methods will accept a query from a query file which will be constructed . 
The constructed query file will contain twenty names which are to be searched for and deleted from the AVL Tree. 
 
After the AVL Tree has been created and the corresponding operations function accordingly. 
We will then recall our assignment 1 project which contained a different data structure called a BinarySearchTree(BST) containing operations like search, delete and insert. 
SearchIt class uses the BST  for searching for a query from a query file just like the SearchAVL . 
We then instrument our code by inserting timekeeping operations , these will help conduct an experiment with SearchIt (from previous assignment) and SearchAVL to demonstrate the speed difference for searching between a BST and an AVL tree.  
We then measure the speed of insertion, deletion and search operations.  
We extract names from the data file and use only these names as queries.
